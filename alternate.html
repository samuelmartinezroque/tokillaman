  "description": "Samuel Quinyones — also known simply as Samuel or by the project name “To Kill a Man” — is a Mexican singer-songwriter born on September 22 in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico. Blending raw emotion with poetic lyricism, his music explores themes of identity, grief, and spiritual survival, delivered through a unique mix of indie folk and pop. Bilingual in Spanish and English, Samuel writes and performs with deep cultural and personal resonance. Active since 2024, he has released a series of works that have resonated with outsider communities, including his debut album 'To Kill a Man'. Samuel continues to create from the borderlands, giving voice to stories that often go unheard.",
